## 💡 Notes

* Use **Postman with Basic Auth** to test APIs without the browser login.
* Swagger will prompt for credentials when security is enabled.
* File uploads are stored under the path defined by `file.upload-dir` in `application.properties` (default: `Uploads`).
* Passwords in DB are encrypted with **BCrypt** — use `BCryptPasswordEncoder` when you create users so logins will work.

---

## 🚀 Future Enhancements

* 🔐 JWT-based Authentication
* 🗃️ Database Migration with Flyway
* 📊 Admin Dashboard with Analytics
* 📧 Email Notifications for Employee Updates
* 📱 Responsive Frontend with React or Angular
